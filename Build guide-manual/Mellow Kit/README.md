# This page is a WIP (Work in Progress)

Additional information for Kit owners/builders. In this section you can find more information for the build process and evolution of the project.
This is still a beta release, and we will try our best to help you through this build.

# What do I need to print?:

This section will help to determine what you need to print in advance for the build. It will be devided by section and STLs can be found in the [Assemblies BOM and STL](/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL)

## Alignment tools: 
You will need to print the Z aligment tool for 10mm Rods to install the Z assembly. You do not need to print the MGN rail aligment tool(s) as the gantry is pre-assembled.

## Frame
All the STL found in [frame section](/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/Frame) Except the rear top brace for motor tensioner. (These braces are for people running with no enclosure)

## Gantry
Gantry comes pre-assembled with most printed parts already there. You will need:
- [Y gantry](/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/Gantry/Y%20gantry/Aluminum%20Y%20Gantry):  Pre-assembled with idler spacers. You only need the tube spacers. Mesure you CF tube in height. If your tube is 20mm tall, then you will need to print 4 spacers (2 on each side) of 0.5mm. The Y gantry has an opening of 21mm, so you will need to compensate for 1mm if your tube is 20mm. So 0.5mm spacers between Y gantry and tube. (One top and one bottom to keep it centered). If your tube is 20.5mm, then you have a 0.5mm to compensate, so print spacers with 0.25mm height (scale them in Z in your your slicer to the desired height).

...... work in progress..
