Print head asemblies.

The Print head is a modified EVA carriage to fit the VzBoT. The EVA project is owned and maintained by Pawel. Big thanks and credits to the man behind this.

Note: Difference between MGN12 and MGN9 is only the TOP part of EVA, so one could just change the TOP. That is the only difference in the CAD models.
