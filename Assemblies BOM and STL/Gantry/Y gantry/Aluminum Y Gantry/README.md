Design Credit of the aluminum bracket: Diemex 

Notes:
  
  -Left side has a X limit switch stopper.
  
  -The back spacer is rotated 180degree from left to right gantry so it helps with belt clearance
  
  # Important:
  -Carbon tube are not always precise to 20x20mm. They range from 20 to 21mm depending how lucky you are. So if your tube is not close to 21mm, use the spacer in the STLs section (spacer_alu_Y_gantry_0.5mm.stl). One can also scale the height of the spacer in slicer accordingly. Put the spacers between CF tube and Y aluminum gantry.
  
  -If you use a 20mm profile OR the F3D aluminum tube, you will need to print 4 spacers of 0.5mm and place between the tube and Y aluminum gantry. One on top of the tube, one at the bottom of the tube, sandwiched between Y aluminum gantry and the aluminum tube
