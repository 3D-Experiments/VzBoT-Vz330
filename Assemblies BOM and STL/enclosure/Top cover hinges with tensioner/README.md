# NOTE:
- depending on the thickness used for the rear enclosure aluminum panel (or acrylic or whatever panel used) versus the thickness of the top cover acrylic panels, you maybe need to add spacers behind the bottom part of the hinges to match the thickness of the top cover rear panel. Spacers STLs can be found in the STL folder. Scale them to desired size
