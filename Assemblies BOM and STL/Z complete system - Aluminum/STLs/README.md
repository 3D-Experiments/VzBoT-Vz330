# Beta testers notice:
If you are a beta tester, the first kits were made with a little mistake. M3 Holes/threads for the chain support were forgotten. In the STL folder, you can find a drilling template for the bed support as shown bellow. You can either drill 3mm holes and use bolts + nuts. Or drill 2.5mm and tap with M3 and use M3 bolts on both side as per the munal.
Or, you can also use just a wire loom or a wire sleeve if you prefer.

We are deeply sorry for the inconvenience
