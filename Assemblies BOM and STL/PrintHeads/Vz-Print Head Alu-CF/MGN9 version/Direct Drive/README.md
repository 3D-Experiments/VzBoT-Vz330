# Direct Drive has some options, and more will come later.

## Compatible extruders:

- [Vz-Hextrudort](https://github.com/VzBot3D/VzBot/tree/master/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/Vz-HextrudrORT) : Will mount from the bottom with the same holes as LGX lite
- LGX Lite 
- (Not recommended) Hextrudort  (One can decide to use the official HextrudORT version to bolt directly on the hotend without using the adapter plate. This will work but the disanvatage is that you will have to dismantle the Hextrudort everytime you will want to remove the hotend)

Installation:

- Start by installing the extruder on the top plate 2x8mm M3 ultra low profile

- Then mount your hotend to the adapter plate.
