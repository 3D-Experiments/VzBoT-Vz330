The Mosquito Magnum+ is a very long type of hotend, and a bit heavier than others. When using bowden configuration, you can not bolt the M+ to the top plate directly as the bolts will interfere with the Bowden pneumatic fitting (PC4-M4). So you have to use the adapter plate.

Due to it's weight, it is highly suggested to add lower braces to support the M+. The bellow option is using thin (0.3mm) titanium sheet that you can cut manually to size using normal metal cisor. It will secure to the M2.5 bolts on the M+ that is used to hold the thermistors. Titanium must be used due to it's low thermal conductivity. Heat transfer will be minimal, and transfered to the carriage M3 bolts. It would be best to chose the bottom carriage plate in Aluminum instead of Carbon Fiber. (We will be testing the carbon fiber option soon to see if it is affected by heat)

# Hardware needed:

- (2xM2.5 5mm Ultra Low profile screws - To mount the Mosquito to the Adapter plate)
- (2xM3 6mm Ultra low profile screws - To attach to top plate 
- (Titanium sheet 0.3mm  https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ACf8Xs )

Measurement to cut titanium sheet. Or you can print the stancil in the STL folder.
