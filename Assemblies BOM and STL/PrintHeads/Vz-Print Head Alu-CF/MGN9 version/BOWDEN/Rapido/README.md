Nova Hotend has 2 options here. Since the Hotend is very short in lenght when you do not use the Groove mount.

# OPTION 1: 
One can use the LGX Lite Adapter plate plus a 2mm printed spacer to lower it down so it sits low enough to reach the bed and the fan duct at its highest position

- (2xM2.5 5mm Ultra Low profile screws - To mount the Nova to the LGX Adapter plate)	
- (2xM3 6mm Ultra low profile screws - To attach to top plate)

# OPTION 2
One can use the Nova Groove mount (Either the long or the short one. Shorter is better here. But both work) with the Groove Mount adapter

- (2x M3 10mm of your choice - To secure the nova in the groove mount clamp)
- (2x M3 14mm of your choice - To secure the adapter to the top plate)
- (2x M3 washer behind the M3 14mm bolt)

NOTE : We had to leave 1.1mm space between the groove mount and the top to avoid interfering with LGX Mounting bolt. To have better stability/rigidity, one can add a 1.1mm spacer on top of the groovemount. (STL provided in the STL folder)
