The Mosquito Magnum+ is a very long type of hotend, and a bit heavier than others. When using bowden configuration, you can not bolt the M+ to the top plate directly as the bolts will interfere with the Bowden pneumatic fitting (PC4-M4). So you have to use the adapter plate.

Due to its weight, it is highly suggested to add lower brace to support the M+. The bellow option is using thin titanium sheet that you can cut manually to size using normal metal cisor.
