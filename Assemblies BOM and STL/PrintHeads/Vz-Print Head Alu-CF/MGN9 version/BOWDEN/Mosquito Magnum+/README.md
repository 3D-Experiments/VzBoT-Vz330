The Mosquito Magnum+ is a very long type of hotend, and a bit heavier than others. When using bowden configuration, you can not bolt the M+ to the top plate directly as the bolts will interfere with the Bowden pneumatic fitting (PC4-M4). So you have to use the adapter plate.

# Hardware needed:

- (2xM2.5 5mm Ultra Low profile screws - To mount the Mosquito to the Adapter plate or directly to the top plate)
- (2xM3 6mm Ultra low profile screws - To attach to top plate (Not needed if you use Volcomosq/Crazy Volcano))
