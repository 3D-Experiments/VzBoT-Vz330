Nova Hotend has 2 options here. Since the Hotend is very short in lenght when you do not use the Groove mount.

# OPTION 1: 
One can use the LGX Lite Adapter plate plus a 2mm printed spacer to lower it down so it sits low enough to reach the bed and the fan duct at its highest position

# OPTION 2
One can use the Nova Groove mount (Either the long or the short one. Shorter is better here. But both work) with the Groove Mount adapter
